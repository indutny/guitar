# Advancements

* Right hand has to glide over strings. It can be pretty relaxed and yet muting
  the strings. It should not be necessary for it to be parallel to the strings
  when playing the low notes.
* Watch the position of left hand. It shouldn't wiggle when you use pinky.
* Right hand moves from elbow, not shoulder. In fact shoulder should be relaxed.
  It can be anchored to the body of the guitar most of the time
* Don't fret two strings with left index! (easy to check with hammer-ons,
  pulls-of. get's tons of noise even on alternate picking!)
  Make sure that the index finger on the left hand doesn't lay flat on the
  strings. You have to angle the index finger's pad just as the other fingers
  and then curl it around the strings. Otherwise you are going to press both
  strings
* It is okay to start playing quietly and then develop strength
* Angling pick is important. It is harder to do alternate picking with a flat
  pick as it gets stuck on strings
* It is equally important to touch strings with a tip of the pick. When not
  playing - one can place a tip of the pick on the string that is about to get
  plucked to get the feel of how deep the pick is
* Make breaks when feeling strain to build tolerance. Avoid prolonged exercising
  without breaks
* Don't plant index finger on a string (lazy index finger). It is okay to lift
  it slightly when it is not used, and it helps to move it faster to the next
  string.
